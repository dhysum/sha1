       This project started as an academic exercise.  Basically, I
       wanted to find an intermediate (practical) programming
       challenge in order to explore the more advanced aspects of c.

       Reference Federal Information Processing Standard 
       Publications (FIPS PUBS) 180-1 and FIPS PUB 180-2 for
       specification of the sha-1 hash function. FIPS PUBS
       are issued by the National Institute of Standards and
       Technology (NIST).

 FILE DESCRIPTIONS:

 README        - this file!
 makefile      - Makefile to build project
 LICENSE       - General Public License v3 (GPLv3)

**********************************************************************
 DIR STRUCTURE:


 TODO:  describe the purpose for each directory

**********************************************************************

 BUILD: 

 To build the basic executable (without verbose output enabled), run:

   :$ make 

   - Without modification to the makefile, this will produce an
     executable named 'sha1'.

 To build the executable with verbose output enabled, run:

   :$ make verbose

   - Without modification to the makefile, this will produce an
     executable named 'sha1-gdb'.  This will also define the
     DEBUG preprocessor directive.

   - Running this program will produce a verbose ouput which
     prints the components of the hash algorithm for each round.
     This is good to see how things are working and to verify
     the output against the examples listed in the appendix
     of the specification.  Included in the 'tests' directory
     are two files, sha_spec_example{1,2}.txt.  These files
     represent the two of the three example cases located in
     the specification for the sha-1 algorithm.

 To build and run the test suite located in the 'tests' directory,
 run:

   :$ make
   :$ make run-test

   - 'make run-test' will execute the script in the tests directory
     which will loop over all the .txt files locaed in the directory
     and run the actual 'sha1sum' program and then run 'sha1'.
     The message digests will be side-by-side (so to speak), so you
     will be able to visually inspect the digest for correctness.

**********************************************************************

 INSTALL: 

 To install the executable in $(HOME)/bin, run:

   :$ make install

   - If you don't have a $(HOME)/bin directory or do not want to
     install it, it can safely be run from the project
     directory where it was built.

 To uninstall the executable, run:

   :$ make uninstall

**********************************************************************

 USAGE:

 To obtain a sha1 message digest for a particular file, run:

   :$ sha1 <filename>

 To obtain a sha1 message digest for several files, run:

   :$ sha1 <filename1> <filename2> <filename3>

   - For now, the output is sent to stdout.  Maybe a future update
     will include the option to send the msg digest to another
     output file.
